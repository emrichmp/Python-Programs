	Hi, My name is Emrich-Michael Perrier and I like to go by Emrich. I am born and raised in New York City and I like to spend my time going to the gym, playing Rugby and listening
to music. I took ECS 102 last year and learned Java, however I don't remember any of it and did poorly in the class. I did the assignments and homeworks very poorly. Before that i took 
Game design in Highschool and we learned processing which is similar to Java. we made simple games and it made me really enjoy coding and choose Computer Science as my major. I did really
enjoy coding which is why I chose my major and I would love to develope software for big companies. I'm taking this course because my history at Syracuse is really poor academically
and I am considering transferring to another school due to my financial situation at home. I am taking this course because I previously got a D in it and those credits would most
likely not transfer to the schools I'm considering attending. I am very comfortable with English and I think I learn most through reading and visuals. I actually enjoy math to a certain
degree and I placed into Pre-Calc when I came to SU. I am now taking Calculus 1 and I have taken ECS 102 before but I am taking it again for credit reasons and to be honest I remember 
almost nothing from my past coding experience. I am working on a Lenovo PC running Windows 8.1 but might be upgrading soon due to the laptop being a couple years old. There is a lot of
personal things in this paragraph so I respectfully ask if this would not be shared with anyone, because there is a lot of unfortunate things I would like to put in the past. I'm very
excited to take this class this semester!
